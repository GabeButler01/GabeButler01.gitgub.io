  <h2>CREATIVE</h2>
  <p>Throughout my academic career, I have completed several personal and assigned projects. Here is a showcase of some of those pieces.</p>
  <br>

      <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/41628641-32d5-4d7a-ad4b-1ddae7a90cb6-1431/"><img src="./img/plant.png" alt="A potted plant with smiley face" class="center"></a>
    
      <div>
        <h4>Bloom [XD]</h4>
        <h5>Class: Design Foundations</h5>
        <p>This assignment involved creating a prototype of an app. This app's purpose is to be a plant
          game that promotes healthy lifestyles. The water you drink translates to the water your plant
          gets and the amount of time you spend outside promotes plant growth.

      <div>
        <h4>NFT Awareness [Photoshop]</h4>
        <h5>Class: Meaning of Information Technology</h5>
        <p>To raise awareness of the harmful environmental effects of NFTs, my group and I created 
          a series of solutions. This is an example of a poster that could educate people further
          about the truth of NFTs. Other solutions were pseudocode that scanned celebrity social
          media pages for NFTs and pop-ups that list objective facts about the CO2 output of NFTs.

      <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1aX0_b1cgzMHRPAhQwkraYi7xId_XMyi0"><img src="./img/portraitCover.JPG" alt="A colorful image of grass with childish illustrations and the words 'Through the Eyes of a Child'" class="center"></a>
    
      <div>
        <h4>Reframing the Portrait [Lightroom Classic & Photoshop]</h4>
        <h5>Class: Image</h5>
        <p>This book frames the poem "Through the Eyes of a Child" by Ruth Warren.
          The goal of it was to show the world from a child's perspective. 
          It begins overly saturated with an extremely bright view but turns darker 
          like the poem does. The childish illustrations on top of the photos add to the 
          youthful nature of the piece and demonstrate a wild imagination. 
          Instead of presenting the world the way it usually looks, 
          the edits to the photos show the skewed reality that children perceive.

      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUx_LlvLMdZ0u9TavPzaBgkvvljd6e3m/view?usp=sharing"><img src="./img/happyBook.jpg" alt="Yellow and black text that says 'I'm trying to be happy'" class="center"></a>

      <div>
        <h4>Expressive Booklet [Illustrator]</h4>
        <h5>Class: Text</h5>
        <p> This booklet relays the lyrics and tone of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Bj_6idYqc&ab_channel=comfibeats">"happy" by LilyPichu</a>.
          Only two fonts along with black, white, and one other color (yellow) were allowed.
          The song is upbeat but has sad lyrics, so the goal of the piece was to create a false illusion of joy.

      <div>
        <h4>Sushi [Blender]</h4>
        <h5>Self-taught</h5>
        <p> This piece was one of my first creations in Blender and set the foundation for many more.
          Several technincal elements were required to execute this and this still is one of my favorite
          works that I have made in Blender. This also was published in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/honorsjournal/sites/default/files/attached-files/hj2022-insidepages.pdf#page=78">2022 CU Honors Journal</a>.
