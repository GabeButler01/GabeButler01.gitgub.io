      <h2>CODING</h2>
      <p>I have coding for several years in many languages. Here are some of my proudest works.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <main class="grid">
            <a href="https://github.com/ATLS1300/pc04-generative-section13-gabe"><img src="./img/pc04Examples.png" alt="Randomly generated rainbows" class="center"></a>
            
            <div>
              <h4>Generative Art (Python)</h4>
              <h5>Class: Computational Foundations</h5>
              <p>In this assignment, I created a program that utilized Python's turtle library which drew images of rainbows. 
                  The colors of the rainbow, the sky color, and the the clouds in the sky were randomly generated each time.
                  This means that each time the program is run, a unique output is returned.</p>  
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Blockchain (C++)</h4>
              <h5>Class: Data Structures</h5>
              <p>This program simulates a simple Blockchain that tracks imaginary exchnages of the cryptocurrency called Buff-CUoins.
                There are several functions such as: adding a transaction, checking the validity of the blockchain, and mine the pending transactions.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h4>Data Lab (C)</h4>
              <h5>Class: Computer Systems</h5>
              <p>This assignment involved several puzzles realted to bit-wise operations. 
                  Examples of tasks were reversing the bytes of an input, multiplying by 5/8 without risking overflow,
              and returing a bit-level expression for -f.</p>
